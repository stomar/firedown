.SH NAME
firedown \- file-based (remote) shutdown
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B firedown
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIdirectories\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
firedown is a command line tool
that enables a remote shutdown of a Linux system
via Dropbox or other file synchronization services.
.PP
firedown monitors a specified directory (or several directories)
on the system for the presence of a trigger file or directory.
If a trigger is found, firedown issues a shutdown.

The monitored directory might be synchronized via a remote service
like Dropbox or Ubuntu One, thus enabling a remotely triggered
shutdown of the system.
